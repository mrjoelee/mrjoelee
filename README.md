### Welcome there! ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ I am a Veteran and an alumni of Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) https://military.microsoft.com/programs/microsoft-software-systems-academy/

ðŸŒ± Love learning something new everyday, specially in Coding! 

âš¡ Fun fact: I speak 3 languages, while I know only 1 (C#) in Coding, but that will change soon! ðŸ˜„
